#This file contains the measurements of lines in the MagE sample. Generated by EW_fitter.py.
#Columns are:
#label: shortlabel of the galaxy/knot
#line_lab: label of the line the code was asked to fit
#obs_wav: observed frame wavelength of the line (A)
#rest_wave: rest frame wavelength of the line (A)
#type: is it emission or ism etc.
#EWr_fit: eqv width as calculated from the Gaussian fit to the line (A)
#EWr__fit_u: error in above qty. (A)
#EWr_sum: eqv width as calculated by summing the flux (A)
#EWr_sum_u: error in above qty. (A)
#f_line: flux i.e. area under Gaussian fit (erg/s/cm^2)
#f_line_u: error in above qty. (erg/s/cm^2)
#med_bin_flux: median of binned fluxes. Each bin is +/-2 sigma wide. There are 5 bins on either side of a group of line asked to be fit, beyond the +/-5 sigma window. This is to take into account the wiggles in the spectrum
#mad_bin_flux: median absolute deviation of the above binned fluxes
#MAD_significance: (f_line - med_bin_flux)/mad_bin_flux. Probably should NOT be USED anymore
#EW_3sig_lim_Schneider: 3sigma upper limit for unresolved OR detection criteria for resolved EWs, as determined using Schneider et al. 1993 prescription
#EW_significance: ratio of EWr_fit to (EW_3sig_lim_Schneider/3). Probably use this for SIGNIFICANCE
#fit_cont: continuum, as from the fit (continuum normalised fit)
#fit_fl: amplitude, as from the fit (continuum normalised fit)
#fit_cen: center, as from the fit (continuum normalised fit)
#fit_cen_u: error in above qty. (A)
#fit_sig: sigma, as from the fit (A)
#zz: Corrected redshift of this line, from the fitted center
#zz_u: error in above qty.
#NaN means the code was unable to fit the line.
